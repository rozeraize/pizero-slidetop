# pizero-slidetop
A more compact slidetop with the Orange Pi Zero 2 W.

This obviously will not come with the features of my original slidetop such as a camera module or an NVMe slot, but it wil be less power hungry. I am also changing the sliding hinge design to one that is more simular to the hinge design found in this video 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jntHraUABHo'.
# WARNING
This is still under development and its not even under the beta prototype testing phase of the project. I will once again update the CAD files as I work on this and hopefully make proper documentation in the near future.

# TO-DO

1. I will wan't to replace the Orange Pi Zero 2 W with the more powerfull and slightly larger RADXA Zero 2 Pro at some point in the future.
2. I will also wan't to replace many of the parts which we're cut from an acryllic panel with 3D-printed parts.
3. I will wan't to create better documentation some time in the future.
